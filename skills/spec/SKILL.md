description: Create executable specs and acceptance criteria before implementation.

# /clearpath:spec


Run the Spec phase.

Outputs:
- `SPEC.md` with user stories and acceptance criteria.
- Edge cases and non-goals.
- Testability notes.
- API/data assumptions.

Do not plan implementation until the spec is concrete enough to verify.


## Clearpath invariants

- Do not treat artifacts as automatic context. Read `docs/clearpath/BOOT.md`, then `CURRENT_CONTEXT.md`, then the active `CHANGE_INDEX.md` before drilling into details.
- Use the three required MCP capabilities when relevant: Serena for symbol/navigation, Codebase-Memory for large-repo knowledge, and Chrome DevTools MCP for browser QA.
- Keep the main session as orchestrator. Use focused subagents for heavy research, planning, execution, review, and QA.
- Do not implement production UI before design approval exists.
- Do not install dependencies, edit secrets, run destructive data commands, or deploy production without manual user approval outside Claude Code.
- Record durable product/change state in artifacts, but summarize current state in `CURRENT_CONTEXT.md` and `CHANGE_INDEX.md`.
